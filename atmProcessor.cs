/* atmProcessor -version 0.1 - authored by Alex Reid
 * For use in CSCI305 Fall 2016 Lab #4 - ATM 
 * 
 * atmProcessor attempts to process the file gotten from atmDriver
 * and determine the amount of money needed to be dispensed and the 
 * amount of each denomination. Will return exception if file not found.
 *
 * atmProcessor should also handle cases where amounts for a
 * certain denomination(s) may not be given due to incorrect 
 * input formatting. i.e. = [m, n5, n10, , , ]
                            [m, n5, n10]
                            [m, n5]
